This does not include the immeasurable deaths that will occur due to extreme climate events and forced migration .

Efficient implementation of adaptation strategies can significantly reduce adverse health impacts of climate change . The effectiveness of adaptation strategies will depend upon cultural , educational , managerial , institutional , legal and regulatory practices that are both domestic and international in scope . In order to adapt for health impacts there is a critical general need for a sound and broadly-based public health infrastructure ( including environmental management , public education , food safety regimes , vaccination programmes , nutritional support , emergency services and health status monitoring ) . This must be supplemented by health-directed policies in other sectors , including transport , urban planning , industry , agriculture , fisheries , energy , water management and so on .
