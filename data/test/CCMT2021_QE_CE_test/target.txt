Recently, a team from the future interface team at Carnegie Mellon University has come up with a novel way to "touch" VR users to the virtual surface.
The idea solves the technology that VR has been bothering, that is, only the infiltration of visual perception, and no real body touch.
In the face of the great epidemic and disaster , the only solution is that the whole world work together to overcome the difficulties . However , the old security concepts and alliance relations such as the cold war mentality , zero-sum game and political prejudice , as well as traditional security issues created by human being such as the game between major powers , geopolitics and conflict hotspots are still the insurmountable obstacles for international security cooperation . The UN secretary-general proposes for the global truce under epidemic situation which expresses the collective aspirations of the human community .
The team developed a prototype system called "wireless" that allows users to "touch" objects when they encounter objects in VR scenes.
The keypoint of this battle lies in the flag-hanging . Then , the nine sons of Meng Ziyou strived to be a flag bearer .
From the current prototype, wireity can be fitted to the user's shoulder, with a spring rope attached to the finger sleeve.
Users need to wear finger sleeves and wrist and palm belts during use.
In short, it is to make people feel real in the virtual world through the touch of limbs by means of sensors and link devices. That is, in VR scene, we can touch things in virtual space.
The technology, released by the future interface group at Carnegie Mellon University, is based on springs to simulate real touch, so that the fingers, palms and wrist parts can feel the resistance and part of the shape of the surface of the object, and the spring rope can be released when the hand no longer touches the virtual object.
Although we always cursed and disliked it , we hadn 't no ideas to leave it alone .
At present, the prototype is considering commercialization, and the commercial products have the advantages of lightweight, low cost and low power consumption.
But this product must not be the ultimate product of VR control technology, but only a starting product, which opens a door for VR to enter human life and form revolutionary subversion.
